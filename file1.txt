Whenever I start a new novel I like to go back to basics, which usually means picking up a few of my favorite writing books. Even now, eighteen novels in, I still find myself wondering what the heck I’m doing. Not so much why do I write — I’m pretty clear in my own head why I do what I do. No, I actually find it quite beneficial to revisit a different question — what is a name?
